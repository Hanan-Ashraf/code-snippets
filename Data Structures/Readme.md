# Data Structures Playground

Welcome to the Data Structures Playground! This repository provides implementations of Max Heap, Min Heap, and Expression Tree data structures. These implementations are designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it accessible for anyone to grasp the fundamentals of these advanced data structures.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains implementations of the following data structures:

- **Max Heap:** Implementation of a Max Heap data structure with operations like insertion, deletion, and heapify.
- **Min Heap:** Implementation of a Min Heap data structure with operations like insertion, deletion, and heapify.
- **Expression Tree:** Implementation of an Expression Tree data structure for evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Getting Started

Each data structure is organized in its own directory. Inside each directory, you will find a README file explaining the structure, the main implementation file, and an example file showcasing common operations specific to that data structure.

Feel free to explore the directories, understand the code, and run the examples to see the data structures in action.

## Why Choose Our Implementations?

- **Simplicity:** We focus on simplicity in our implementations, ensuring that even complex data structures like Max Heap, Min Heap, and Expression Trees are approachable for beginners.
- **Comments and Documentation:** Code is thoroughly commented, explaining each step and decision made during implementation. This helps in understanding the logic behind the code.
- **Example Operations:** Each data structure comes with example operations demonstrated in the respective example files. You can see how to use these structures in real-world scenarios.
- **Easy Integration:** The code is designed to be easily integrated into your projects. You can copy the implementations directly or use them as a reference for your own implementations.

## Contributing

If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or want to enhance the existing implementations, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. Let's make learning and understanding Max Heap, Min Heap, and Expression Trees easier for everyone!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
